Today we learn a few topics in R:

- databases
- working with date
- ggplot2
- R markdown

## Homework:

Explore Data Frame `diamonds` and create 5 visualizations.

### Chart 1 - Relationship between carat and price
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
head(diamonds)
```

Create my first chart!
```{r}
set.seed(69)
ggplot(diamonds %>% sample_n(500), 
       aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_minimal()
```

We found a positive relationship between two variables.

Another chart!
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut, fill = color)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  theme_minimal()
```

We found that diamonds with color [J] have the least quantity compared to other colors of diamonds.

### Chart 2 - Relationship between color and price
```{r}
set.seed(69)
ggplot(diamonds %>% sample_frac(0.1), 
       aes(color, price)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between color and price",
    x = "Color",
    y = "Price (USD)",
    subtitle = "We found that color G is the most expensive diamond of all colors.",
    caption = "Data source: diamonds (ggplot2)"
  )

```

### Chart 3 - Cut count for each clarity type
```{r}
set.seed(69)
ggplot(diamonds %>% sample_frac(0.1),
       aes(cut, fill = clarity)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Cut count for each clarity type",
    x = "Cut",
    y = "Count in Percentage",
    subtitle = "SI1 is the most common clarity for each type of cut, and IF is the least common.",
    caption = "Data source: diamonds (ggplot2)"
  )
```

### Chart 4 - Relationship between cut and price
```{r}
set.seed(69)
ggplot(diamonds %>% sample_frac(0.1), 
       aes(cut, price, fill = cut)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between cut and price",
    x = "Cut",
    y = "Price (USD)",
    subtitle = "We found that Ideal cut is the most expensive of all cuts of diamonds.",
    caption = "Data source: diamonds (ggplot2)"
  ) 
```

### Chart 5 - Multiple charts in one board
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(patchwork)
p1 <- qplot(carat, data = diamonds %>% sample_frac(0.1), geom = "histogram", bins = 10)
p2 <- qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds %>% sample_frac(0.1), geom = "point")
p3 <- qplot(cut, price, data = diamonds %>% sample_frac(0.1), geom = "col")

((p1 + p2) / p3)
```

#### We found that:
1. The more carat a diamond has, the rarer it will be.
2. The more carat a diamond has, the more expensive it will be.
3. The cut quality of diamonds affects their price. The better quality diamonds are, the more expensive they will be.

#### In conclusion: 
Diamonds with more carats are harder to find and are more expensive. Also, diamonds with better quality are more expensive.
